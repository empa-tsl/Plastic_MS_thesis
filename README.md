Abstract: Detailed knowledge about polymer flows through the anthroposphere and into the environment is information essential to the better management of plastics. Currently, only limited knowledge about specific polymer flows is available. This work aimed to model those flows for five polymers: polyurethane (PUR), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Probabilistic material flow analysis (PMFA) was used to quantify flows from production in 45 product categories to their end-of-life in Europe and Switzerland. We then considered 40 release pathways for macro- and microplastic flows to assess polymer release into Switzerland's environment. PMFA results showed considerable variations between the polymers considered because their flows through the anthroposphere are determined by their different uses. Total macro- and microplastic emissions into Switzerland's environment in 2018 were estimated at masses of 208±76 t for PA, 179±98 t for PUR, 79±26 t for PC, 36±23 t for PMMA and 25±6 t for ABS. Relative to Switzerland's total production and imports, this amounted to total releases of 0.23% of PA, 0.07% of PUR, 0.16% of PC, 0.32% of PMMA and 0.14% of ABS. Contributions as released microplastics ranged from 18% of PMMA to 75% of ABS. These results showed that the amounts of the polymers considered released into the environment were much smaller than previously assumed in simpler release estimates, and they may be more realistic for countries with well-functioning waste treatment systems.
